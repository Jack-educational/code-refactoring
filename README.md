  ## Description
  This is the first assignment of the frontend developer bootcamp that is in the style of an on-the-job ticket. This means we begin with starter code that we need need to modify. The modification involves accessibility improvement such as addition of ALT attributes to IMG tags as well as refactoring the HTML to make use of semantic tags which are structured appropriately e.g. headings in the correct hierarchy.
