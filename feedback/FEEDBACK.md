# Feedback Checklist for second submission

There are still a few divs that can be converted to semantic tags, for example you can add a nav tag that wraps around the navbar items. 

You as well commented out your CSS file, which is a great habit to form. There are a few comments but there should be much more.

There were a few points deducted for the heading attributes not being in sequential order as there is an h2 inside of your footer.

Your README.md is missing a detailed description, a screenshot of the application, and a link to the deployed live link - minus 5 points
